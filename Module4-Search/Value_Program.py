# ----------
# User Instructions:
#
# Create a function compute_value which returns
# a grid of values. The value of a cell is the minimum
# number of moves required to get from the cell to the goal.
#
# If a cell is a wall or it is impossible to reach the goal from a cell,
# assign that cell a value of 99.
# ----------

        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]]

    # make sure your function returns a grid of values as
    # demonstrated in the previous video.
